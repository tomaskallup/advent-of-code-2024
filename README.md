# Advent of Code 2024 in C3
My attempt at Advent of Code for 2024 in C3.

## Running

### Short example input
 - Run the desired day `make run-example DAY=2`.
 - It should print the results for both puzzles of the day, for the short example.

### Your own input
 - Place your input in the `inputs` folder. It should be named day${DAY}.txt, where DAY is the number of the day.
 - Run the desired day `make run DAY=2`.
 - It should print the results for both puzzles of the day.
